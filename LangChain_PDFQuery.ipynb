              "' 30  \\nCHAPTER – 2 \\n \\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF INDIAN CINEMA \\n \\n       Indian films are unquestionably the most –seen movies in the world. Not just \\ntalking about the billion- strong audiences in India itself, where 12 million people are \\nsaid to go to the cinema every day, but of large audiences well beyond the Indian \\nsubcontinent and the Diaspora, in such unlikely places as Russia, China, the Middle \\nEast, the Far East Egypt, Turkey and Africa. People from very different cultural and \\nsocial worlds have a great love for Indian popular cinema, and many have been Hindi \\nFilms fans for over fifty years. \\n     Indian cinema is world – famous for the staggering amount of films it produces: \\nthe number is constantly on the increase, and recent sources estimate that a total \\noutput of some 800 films a year are made in different cities including Madrass , \\nBangalore , Calcutta and Hyderabad . Of this astonishing number, those films made in \\nBombay, in a seamless blend of Hindi and Urdu, have the widest distribution within \\nIndia and Internationally. The two sister languages are spoken in six northern states \\nand understood by over 500 million people on the Indian sub – continent alone – reason \\nenough for Hindi and Urdu to be chosen above the fourteen official Indian languages to \\nbecome the languages of Indian Popular cinema when sound came to the Indian Silver \\nscreen in 1931 . \\n \\nSilent Era – The cinematographe (from where we have the name cinema) invented by \\nthe Lumiere brothers functioned better the Kinetoscope of Edison and Dickson. The \\nLumiere brothers who invented the cinematographe started projection of short (very \\nshort, one to two minutes long) films for the Parsian public on November 28, 1895. \\nCinema was shown for the first time in India by the Lumiere brothers on July 17, 1896 at \\nthe Watson Hotel in Mumbai. This was just six months after their first show in Paris. \\n        Indian cinema thus has more than a hundred years of history, like the European \\nor American film industry. That first show was just a show of a series of visuals, moving \\nscenes and nothing more, but it inaugurated a long line of movies made by talented \\nIndians. Today India has the distinction of being the country that produces the highest \\nnumber of feature films every year.  \\n      As mentioned above, the earliest show of moving pictures in India was done in \\n1896. But for the next fifteen years, there was no indigenous production of movies. \\n      N.G.Chitre and R .G. Torney of Bombay were the first to make a film based on a \\nstory. It was PUNDALIK, a film based on the life of a Holy man in Maharashtra, it came \\nout in 1912. \\n     The next movie in India was Dhandiraj Govindraj Phalke’s RAJA \\nHARISCHANDRA released on May 3, 1913. D. G. Phalke is acclaimed as the father of \\nthe Indian cinema because he laid the foundation for the future of the Indian film \\nindustry and because he trained several young film makers in his studio in Nasik. The \\nPhalke award perpetuates the memory of this pioneering film maker and it goes to the  31 person who enriches Indian cinema through remarkable contributions to it. Phalke wii \\nalways be remembered for his contributions to the development of the film industry.  \\n    Phalke established his studio in 1913 after his return from England with plenty of \\nenthusiasm and dedication, besides a stock of raw film and a perforator for making \\nholes on the edges of film stripes. He believed that ‘Indians must see Indian movies on \\nthe Indian Silver screen.’ \\n       After his RAJA HARISCHANDRA, Phalke started other projects, but he could \\nnot complete them because of lack of funds .Other silent movies started coming out \\nfrom Calcutta studios: for example, ‘SATYAVAADI HARISCHANDRA ‘(1917) and \\n‘KEECHAKAVADHAM’ (1919). But Phalke’s Nasik studio was the first regular studio \\nwhere he could also train many promising young people as film technicians. It was still \\nthe era of silent movies all over the world. During the Silent Era (1896 – 1930) over a \\nthousand films were made in India; however, only ten of them survive, now restored and \\npreserved in the Pune archives. Meanwhile, American and European films continued to \\ngrow in popularity, though a major source of worry for the imperial Government was that \\nthey would ‘corrupt’ Indian minds. In 1917, the European Association warned the \\nGovernment against a film called ‘The Surpentine Dance’, which was certainly \\ncalculated to bring the white men and women into low esteem in the Indian mind. \\n  \\n Age of sound – The films of the Silent Era did not ‘talk’ but they were never watched in \\n‘silence’. Dialogue was presented through inter – titles, which were often in English, and \\ntwo or three Indian languages. Almost every film had a background score, which ran \\nthrough the length of film. The score was ‘live’, and helped to dramatise the narrative. \\nSometimes there was only a piano accompaniment, but there were several films where \\na violin, a harmonium, tablas and other musical instruments could be added. The first \\nsound movie or talkie, viz, Al Jolson’s ‘Jazz Singer’ in the U.S. ended the silent era in \\nOctober, 1927. \\n      Silent movies continued in India for another decade although the first Indian \\ntalkie came out on March 14, 1931. It was ‘Alam Ara’ (The Light of the world), made by \\nArdeshir Irani, admitted that the idea of making an Indian talkie came from Universal \\npictures production of ‘Show Boat’,which was a 40% talkie . But what kind of Indian film \\ncould maintain this strong link with audiences when sound came to the Indian screen in \\n1931? Over 150 million people at that time understood Hindustani (a mix of Hindi and \\nUrdu, also known as the language of the Bazaar) and as the first talkie was to be made \\nin Bombay, Hindustani was chosen over the fourteen official Indian languages to be the \\nlingua Franca of popular cinema. Once the language question had been resolved, films \\nlooked to the Urdu Parsee Theatre for subject matter. Based on Joseph David’s Urdu \\nParsee play, Alam Ara is a costume drama telling the story of the rivalry of two queens \\nand involving many characters, plots and subplots. This film songs immediately proved \\na smash, particularly the one sung by actor / singer W.M.Khan in the role of a fakir, ‘De \\nde Khuda ke naam par pyare’( Give alms in the name of Allah). Thereafter, songs and \\ndances were established as an integral part of Indian Popular cinema .This genre \\nevolved out of the Urdu Parsee Theatre, a narrative form that had already skillfully \\ndramatized Victorian plays and Persian Love Legends. The courtly love stories of the \\nUrdu Parsee Theatre are probably the reason behind Indian cinema’s dependence on  32 romantic themes and the way they link love, obstacles and tragedy. Another popular \\ngenre of this period was the historical film, based on stories of real characters or \\nlegendary hero’s .The importance of the historical film lay in its patriotic undertones. The \\ngrandeur of Pre – Raj India, the splendid costumes, the etiquette of the nobility and high \\ndrama were a direct invitation for national self – esteem and the will to be independent. \\nOf course, India did not need to be independent to produce films: thousands of miles of \\ncelluloid had run through the projector gate before the British finally packed their bags in \\n1947. Despite having first blossomed under a political power so alien to its own \\nconventions, Indian cinema’s thematic and aesthetic development seems to have \\nremained largely free of direct concern with colonial rule. Individual film director’s were \\ndeeply concerned by the independence movement led by the congress party and \\ndemonstrated their allegiance to the concept of a free India in films such as ‘Sikandra’ ( \\n1941 ) and ‘Shaheed’ ( 1948 ) . In the 1940s and 1950s, a small number of patriotic \\nfilms and a handful of songs with a clear message of Indian nationalism were produced \\n– the most famous is ‘Door Hato O Duniya Valo, Hindustan Hamara Hai’ (‘Go away, you \\ninvaders! India is ours’) in the 1943 film Kismet – but by and large the patriotic film isn’t \\na genre that is hugely popular today. Indian films have never been overtly political, \\nunlike Africa or Algerian cinema, the classics of which are clear indictments of French \\ncolonial rule.  \\n     When talkies came an unexpected criticism from art lovers was that sound \\ndestroyed the aesthetic quality of the movies. Moreover, the universal language of the \\ncinema was adversely affected, they said. People speaking different languages could \\nwatch the silent movie and derive meanings from the acting and expression, and the \\nvisual effectiveness of the whole movie. Cinema is a visual medium, they argued, and it \\nhas its own language. An Englishman must be able to appreciate a Hindi or Tamil movie \\nas much as a Hindi or Tamil – speaking Indian should be able to enjoy an English movie \\neven if the movies are silent ones. But can we imagine how a silent movie would appeal \\nto us now? We have become so used to sound movies. And in India, we cannot easily \\nappreciate a movie without songs and dancing! The silent movies are now in the \\narchives and they are taken out for research or for satisfying someone’s historical \\ncuriosity. \\n     Though colour movies started to come out of American studios from 1935 \\nonwards, it took more decades for color to come to Indian screens. \\n \\nThemes in Indian cinema – Early Indian cinema in the 1920s was founded on specific \\ngenres, such as the mythological or the devotional film. The sum and substance of the \\nmythological theme is the fight between good and evil, and the importance of sacrifice \\nin the name of truth. The retelling of stories known through an oral tradition was an \\nimportant element in the success of the mythological film: The Ram Leela (a celebration \\nand re – enactment of the exploits and adventures of Ram) and the Ras Leela \\n(episodes from Krishna’s life) are said to be of particular influence in Indian cinema. \\nSuch reconfirmation has always been an element of Indian culture. As Arundhuti roy \\nsays in her novel, The God Of Small Things, ‘The Great stories are the ones you have \\nheard and want to hear again.’ Roy was speaking of the Kathakali dance form, but the \\nargument holds good for cinema too. This trend was visible not only in the silent era. It  33 continued in the talkie era. NALLATHANGAL in Tamil, BHAKTA PRAHLADA in \\nMalayalam and other languages, KEECHAKAVADHAM in Tamil etc. are good \\nexamples. In almost all the languages of India, during the silent as well as the talkie era, \\nthemes and episodes from the PURANAS, THE RAMAYANA and MAHABHARATA \\nwere treated cinematically. Some folk tales and legends also became cinematic themes. \\n       A change in this trend came about in the 1950s, particularly in Malayalam, Tamil \\nand Bengali movies. JEEVITA NAUKA (The Boat of life) introduced social and domestic \\ntheme, family life in Kerala and social humour , and it was among the earliest Indian \\nmovies to run for more than six months at a stretch . A more bold theme of socio – \\neconomic disparities and indication of prospective social revolution was expressed in \\nNAVALOKAM. But among the socially relevant movies of the early 1950s in Malayalam, \\nNEELAKKUYIL (Blue Koel) of 1954 depicted the story of powerful love breaking caste \\nbarriers but yielding finally to social pressures and the leading characters coming to \\ngrief in the face of social ostracism. This period also saw big spectacles like \\nCHANDRALEKHA in Tamil and the beautiful celluloid portrayal in the trilogy of Satyajit \\nRay starting with PATHER PANCHALI. PARAASAKTI, the Tamil movie which took \\nSivaji Ganesan to the heights of fame was a strong and defiant portrayal of the collusion \\nbetween religious and economic forces in the suppression of the poor. DO BIGHA \\nZAMIN questioned landlordism. \\n        Later on, Social themes were portrayed. Stories were based on the life of \\nordinary families. Most films were produced in the Bombay and Madras studios. The \\nlargest number of movies came out in Hindi, Tamil, Telegu, Malayalam, Kannada and \\nBengali- in that order. Among the social movies, Andaz and Mela stand out .The \\nproduction of movies in all languages has dwindled in the closing years of the 20th \\ncentury, but the reduction has been more in Malayalam than in the other five languages \\nin which production was consistently high in the 1970s and 1980s. \\n     Of the Historical movies of those days, the first choice falls on ANARKALI. Then \\ncome MUGHAL – E – AZAM and MOTHER INDIA. To the credit of Raj Kapoor and his \\nR.K. Studios, a series of mild but poignant criticism of the oddities in social life of the \\n1950s and 1960s came, that were also great entertainers and pieces of artistic \\nattainments: AWARA, SHRI 420, etc. In the 1970s, Amitabh Bacchan ruled the Indian \\ncine world portraying the defiant angry young man of the new generation. \\n     Till the late 1960s, movies were directed by people who learnt the art on the job. \\nThere were no schools or training institutes for actors, directors, producers and \\ntechnical experts. The National School of Drama, New Delhi and the Film and \\nTelevision Institute (FTII), Pune trained actors and directors and several other personnel \\nconnected with film. This was also the period when serious thinking was given to a \\ncinematic style that was entirely different from what it was in the past. Critics have \\ncalled the new trend ‘New Wave Cinema’. What is termed the ‘New Wave’ in the history \\nof Indian Cinema is not the ‘nouvelle vogue’ of French cinema with which Bresson, \\nGodard and other experimental film makers were associated in the fifties and sixties. In \\nthe Indian context, the terms are rather loosely used to describe the deliberately realist \\nand non-commercial style of film making that sometimes experiments with form and \\ncontent. Its roots are in IPTA theatre, the realist novel, and European cinema (especially \\nRussian, French and Italian). It eschews the escapist Hollywood and the Bombay film  34 traditions, and is concerned more with real – life issues of Indian society than with just \\nentertainment. Other terms used to talk about this cinema are ‘alternative’, ‘parallel’, and \\neven ‘another’ cinema.   \\n  \\nMajor Studios – The creation of the major studios in Madras, Calcutta, Lahore, \\nBombay and Pune in the 1930s was a crucial move in the development of a proficient \\nIndian film industry. Studio owners including Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, V. \\nShantaram, V. Damle and S. Fatehlal set the tune of film production, playing an \\nessential role in promoting national integration. People of all castes, religious, regions, \\nsects and social classes worked together in the various studios. Film production has \\nalways prided itself in the way it has been inclusive and continues to be a shinning \\nexample of communal (i.e. inter religious) harmony and tolerance. Hindus and Muslims \\nwork together and promoting and National Integration and communal harmony has \\nalways been a favourite theme of the Indian film. \\n     The studios, including Bombay talkies, the New Theatres in Calcutta, Prabhat \\nFilm Company and Gemini and Vauhini in Madras, were also responsible for \\nbroadening the choice of screen – subjects, with music as a primary ingredient. Like the \\ngreat Hollywood studios, they experimented with different stories and themes while \\neach developing their own brand of film making. The key films of this period show the \\norigins of themes and subjects that have recurred over subsequent decades of film \\nmaking. For example, the New Theatres films , particularly the 1935 classic DEVDAS by \\nactor / director P.C.Barua , made in both Hindi and Bengali versions , gave Indian \\ncinema its most recurrent theme : the love triangle . DEVDAS is an adaptation of Sarat \\nChandra Chatterjee’s Bengali novel of the same name. This film also gave its most \\nenduring male character: The tragic romantic hero. Devdas is a high caste Brahmin who \\ncannot marry the love of his life, Parvati, his neighbour’s daughter, because she is of a \\nlower caste. He later befriends Chandramukhi, a prostitute who gives up her profession \\nand turns to spirituality. In a downward spiral of self – destruction, the Hamlet like \\nDevdas becomes an alcoholic and ultimately dies at the gate of Parvati’s marital home. \\n     The story of Devdas touched millions of Indians in the 1930s who felt that his \\nanguish would become their own if they dared marry against parental authority. This \\ntheme returns regularly every decade , either in a direct remake , e.g. Bimal Roy’s 1955 \\nDevdas ( director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s new version released in 2002 ) , or as an \\nimportant theme , as in Guru Dutt’s PYASSA (1957 ) or Prakash Mehra’s MUQADDAR \\nKA SIKANDAR ( 1978 ). \\n   V.Shantaram was a co – founder (along with V. Damle , S. Fatehlal and \\nDhaiber) of the Prabhat Film Company , based in Kohlapur and later Pune . He made \\nmany stunts and action films early in his career, favoured socially progressive subjects \\nand dealt with themes considered taboo. Shantaram’s best work included a period \\ndrama about the vengeance of women (AMAR JYOTI, 1936 – the first Indian film to be \\nshown at an International Film Festival, in Venice), the cruel injustices against women \\nbrought about by the arranged marriage system (DUNIYA NA NANE, 1937), to the \\nrehabilitation of a prostitute (AADMI, 1937), and the promotion of Hindu – Muslim \\nfriendship (PADOSI, 1941). In 1942, V. Shantaram left Prabhat to start his own \\nproduction company and studio, Rajkamal Kalamandir , in Bombay. There, he continued  35 to make internationally acclaimed films based on social concerns, including Dr. KUTNIS \\nKI AMAR KAHANI (1946) and DO AANKHEN BARAH HAATH (1957). \\n     Bombay Talkies also made social films, the most celebrated example of which is \\nFranz Osten’s ACHUT KANYA (1936) starring Devika Rani and Ashok Kumar. It was \\none of the first films to deal with the evils of untouchability. Bombay Talkies made many \\npopular movies, including Gyan Mukherji’s afore mentioned KISMET, a film that \\nintroduced another favourite theme in Hindi cinema – the ‘lost and found’. Though the \\nlost and found theme can be traced back to mythology in the story of SHAKUNTALA, \\nKISMET made it popular in cinema. \\n    An interesting twist on this popular theme occurs in Manmohan Desai’s AMAR \\nAKBAR ANTHONY (1977), in which the director depicts three brothers separated as \\nyoung children and brought up by members of the three main Indian religions : \\nHinduism, Islam and Christianity ( hence the names AMAR , AKBAR AND ANTHONY) . \\nThe film was a massive success and Desai himself made several other films combining \\nthe importance of communal harmony with the theme of loss and recovery. In his \\nNASEEB (1981), the Amitabh Bacchan hero is called ‘JOHN, JAANI, JANARDAN’ and \\nis proud to be seen as Christian, Muslim and Hindu. As long as the separated family \\nmembers are played by well – known stars, the audience never seems to tire of the \\nrepetitions of themes. \\n \\nEnd of Studios – Financers who made money during the war years found film – \\nmaking an easy way of gaining quick returns, and this new method of financing movies \\nultimately brought about the end of the studio era. The studio owners could not afford to \\npay high fees for their staff and stars, and so freelancing made a return – a system \\nwhereby all film practitioners were employed on a contract – by – contract basis. The \\nstudio system was over by the late 1940s, and widespread freelancing, established by \\nthe 1950s, set the pattern for film production thereafter.  \\n \\nGolden Age Of Indian Cinema – The 1950s was led film historians to refer to this \\nglorious time as the golden age of Indian Cinema. Film makers created authored and \\nindividual works while sticking strictly within the set conventions of the films. The \\nexample of Mahatma Gandhi and Prime Minister Nehru’s vision of the newly \\nindependent nation was also highly influential throughout the decade, and many \\nexcellent Urdu poets and writers worked with film makers in the hope of creating a \\ncinema that would be socially meaningful. It is no surprise that the 1950s is regarded \\ntoday as the finest period in Indian cinema, and the era has profoundly influenced \\ngenerations of Indian film makers in a way that no other decade has done since. \\n     The best directors of the time, including Mehboob Khan, Bimal Roy, Raj Kapoor \\nand Guru Dutt, brought new depth to established themes. They drew on the wide \\nspectrum of cinema stories, but brought to them a personal vision. The films of the late \\n1940s , 1950s and early 1960s were lyrical and powerful and dealt with themes \\nincluding the exploitation of the poor by rich landlords (DO BIGHA ZAMEEN, 1953), the \\nimportance of sacrifice and honour (MOTHER INDIA), survival in the big city ( BOOT \\nPOLISH, 1954) , untouchability (SUJATA, 1959) , the changing role of the woman (Mr. \\nand Mrs.55, 1955), urban vs rural morality (SHREE 420, 1955), nature vs nurture  36 (AWAARA, 1951), dilemas faced by modern Indians (ANDAZ,1949), materialism vs \\nspiritualism (PYAASA, 1957) and the importance of destiny (CHAUDHVIN KA CHAND, \\n1960). These films show a complex and sophisticated mix of characters, plots, ideas \\nand morals. \\n    The important film makers of this period not only made commercially successful \\nworks but also mastered the language of cinema. They understood how performance, \\nphotography, editing and above all, music could be used to create a new aesthetic. It \\nwas around this time that Indian films started to receive regular worldwide distribution, \\nand films such as AWAARA made by Raj Kapoor and his co- star Nargis major celebrity \\nin places as far afield as Russia and China. Mehboob’s AAN (1952, AKA MANGALA, \\nDaughter of India) and MOTHER INDIA (Perhaps the best known Indian films of all) \\nalso won large audiences beyond the Indian sub continent. \\n    The average Indian film does not pretend to offer a unique storyline. A new twist \\nto a familiar storyline helps a film to succeed, if the audience is looking for originality, \\nthey know it is principally to be found in the score. Film music is of such primary \\nimportance in today’s Indian cinema that it more or less determines the box- office fate \\nof most movies. Leading choreographer Farah Khan believes that, ‘What is saving \\nIndian cinema from being engulfed by Hollywood is our song and dance routines, \\nbecause they just can’t imitate that’. \\n \\nThe Middle Cinema -  Indian Cinema , dominated in the 1970’s by the Sippy’s , \\nHrishikesh Mukherjee , B.R. Ishara and Vijay Anand , was jolted out of its wits when \\nShyam Benegal assisted by Blaze enterprises , shot into prominence with ‘Ankur’ \\n(1974), and later with ‘Nishant’(1975), ‘Manthan’, ‘Bhumika’(1977) and Junoon (1979). \\nBenegal turned his back on the standard ‘Kalyug’ and ‘Aradhana’ (1981) genre, \\ninjecting a dose of caste – politics into his first three films. He was closely associated \\nwith the making of Govind Nihalani’s ‘‘Akrosh’ (1980), a political film about the \\nexploitation of illiterate Adivasis.  ‘Ardh Satya’ (1984), ‘Party’ (an expose of the upper \\nmiddle class), and his TV serial on the partition of India, ‘Tamas’, have been significant \\nsuccess. \\nWhile the films of Mrinal Sen, Mani Kaul and Kumar Shahani did not fare very \\nwell at the box office, those of the ‘middle cinema’ reaped a good harves. Saeed Mirza’s \\n‘Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai’ , ‘Mphan Joshi Hajir Ho’ and ‘Salim Langde Pe \\nMat Ro’ , Rabindra Dharmaraj’s ‘Chakra’ and Ketan Mehta’s ‘ Bhavni Bhavai’ (in \\nGujarati and Hindi), ‘ Mirch Masala’ , and later ‘ Maya Memsahib’ , ‘ Sardar’ , started a \\ntrend in the making of socially conscious and political films which were entertaining as \\nwell . Both the New Wave and the Middle Cinema wilted under the impact of multi- \\nchannel television , ‘ Commercial cinema’ , the commercialization of the National Film \\nDevelopment Corporation (NFDC), and above all the abysmal lack of exhibition outlets . \\nThe gradual decline of the Film Society movement too had a arole in the fading away of \\n‘Parallel cinema’.  \\n \\nThe Second New Wave -  As the century drew to a close , there was a revival of the \\nNew Wave spirit , with some assistance from the NFDC , Doordarshan , overseas TV \\ncompanies such as channel four of Britain , and private financiers . Some termed this  37 revival the ‘Second New Wave’, even though most of the film makers involved in the \\nrevival was also part of the first New Wave. Mani Kaul ( Nazar , The Idiot, Siddeshwari), \\nhyam Benegal (The Making Of The Mahatma , Mammo…….. Saatvan Ka Ghoda , \\nSardari Begum), Saees Mirza (Naseem -1996), Adoor Gopalakrishnan (Kathapurusham \\n– 1995), Girish Kasaravalli (Mane – 1996), Thai Saheb (1998) , Govind Nihalani (Hazar \\nChourasi Ki Maa – 1998), Kumar Shahani (Chaar Adhayay – 1997) and others in \\ndifferent regional languages of the country helped keep the spark of ‘alternative’ cinema \\nalive. The establishment of the National Centre for Children and Young People (NCYP) \\nprovided an impetus to the making of films targeted at Indian Youth.       \\n \\nColour And Triumph Of Romance – The 1980s weren’t a particularly strong time for \\nfilm music either. The movie that brought back music and young romance was Mansoor \\nKhan’s 1988 film QAYAMAT SE QAYAMAT TAK – a love story along the lines of a \\nmodern Romeo and Juliet, showing two young lovers blighted by their feuding families. \\nLead actor Aamir Khan shot to fame as the teen idol of the late eighties. QAYAMAT SE \\nQAYAMAT TAK was followed by Sooraj Barjatya’s MAINE PYAR KIYA in 1989, another \\nromantic movie with great music and family values, which brought another cinematic \\nidol to the fore – Salman Khan. A third actor with the same surname – Sharukh Khan – \\nbecame the biggest new star of the 1990s. Sharukh Khan began his career in the \\ntheatre and television before he got his big break playing a psychopath in BAAZIGAR \\n(1993). He has acted in all of the big hits of the 1990s, including Aditya Chopra’s \\nexcellent romance, DILWALE DULHANIA LEJAYENGE (1995), and Karan Johar’s \\ndelightful KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI (1998). Sharukh Khan believes Indian cinema \\nshares its dependence on love stories and simple plot lines with Hollywood. \\n \\nDuring the struggle for Independence – P.K.Nair, one of the India’s leading film \\nhistorians, believes that D.G.Phalke chose mythology for the cinema not only because it \\nwas an easy means of communicating to the largest number of people, but also \\nbecause Phalke saw mythological stories as a way of evoking patriotic feelings in the \\nIndian Nation at a time when the country was a British colony. By showing Lord Krishna \\novercoming the demon snake Kamsa in in his 1919 film KALIYA MARDAN, Phalke \\nshowed that it was possible to fight the powerful and to challenge the imperialism thyhat \\nhad plundered the whole Nation in the same way the demon snake had poisoned the \\nsacred river. \\n    Social Film- Aside from the mythological, the 1920s saw the birth of other film \\ngenres, such as the social film (examples include OUR HINDUSTAN 1928, and \\nORPHAN DAUGHTER), the historical film celebrating Rajput history and grandeur, the \\nstunt film based on the Hollywood model, and Muslim subjects inspired by Persian love \\nlegends including Laila Majnu and stories set in the splendour of Mughal Courts. The \\nPersian love stories depended on family conflicts, court intrigue, poetic dialogue, and \\nsongs of love and lament and these were better served by cinema after the birth of \\nsound. The Films with Muslim subjects were later developed into the ‘ Muslim Social’, of \\nwhich the author Shahrukh Hussain commented, ‘Predictably, Muslim socials were \\nabout Indian Muslims and were the forum for the portrayal of many social institution of  38 the exotic upper and lower classes of  this community, (The Cambridge Encyclopedia of \\nIndia , 1989 , Cambridge University Press) . \\n \\nStunt Film or Action Movie – Another popular genre starting in the silent era was the \\nstunt film and the adventure action film. The film makers who were largely responsible \\nfor popularizing the stunt film were J.B.H Wadia and his brother Homi Wadia, of Wadia \\nMovietone. They became the kings of this genre, starting with the railroad thriller \\nTOOFAN MAIL (1932), which featured several fight sequences staged on the roof of a \\nmoving train. The Wadia’s loved Hollywood and were directly inspired by American \\nserials, western and slapstick comedies. Their most famous star was the queen of the \\nforties action movie, Fearless Nadia. \\n    The stunt film and the adventure action film did not appeal to everyone: the \\neducated classes saw them as populist, vulgar and a corrupting influence. This division \\nin film styles is why distributors and producers continue to see films as being of two \\nmain categories: ‘films for the classes and films for the masses.’ The assumption was \\nthat the upper classes, who were more educated, expected something substantial from \\ncinema, whereas the poor looked to cinema as pure entertainment. \\n \\nMusic in Silent Era Films – Indian silent films weren’t really silent – as in Hollywood; \\nlive musician provided a sound track. The English language films shown in India’s big \\ncities had a violinist and pianist providing the music. This two – member orchestra was \\nusually musician from Goa – a Portuguese colony at that time – who had studied music \\nand could sight – read. The harmonium and tabla were the main instruments played \\nwith Indian silent films. In his article ‘ Sound in a silent era,’ celebrated music scholar \\nBhaskar Chandavarkar notes that ‘ The harmonium and tabla players were not only the \\nfirst music directors but also dialogue writers and dubbers , as they were expected to \\nstamp their feet , shout and trigger excitement during the action scenes , crying ‘ Maro’  \\n(Hit Him), ‘Chup, Saale’ (‘shut up, you bastard’) or ‘ khamosh’ ( ‘ silence’) while \\nthe villain got what was coming to him . (Cinema Vision, vol.1, January 1980). \\n     Though this genre continued to have a healthy life in south India, in Indian \\ncinema the mythological had virtually disappeared by the 1950s . Later , at the height of \\n1970s action and vendetta films , Vijay Sharma’s low budget movie ‘JAI SANTOSHI \\nMAA’ broke all box – office records by becoming one of the biggest hits of 1975 ( along \\nwith blockbusters such as SHOLAY and DEEWAR ) . This film made Santoshi Maa , a \\nlittle – known Goddess , into a hugely popular icon and many people throughout India \\nkept a fast , or vrat , in Her name . The film’s popularity was so extra ordinary that it \\nlater became the subject of academic study by the Indian and International scholars: the \\nanthropologist Veena Das analysed the film in her essay ‘ The Mythological film and its \\nframe work of meaning’ ( 1980 ) , while American scholar Stanley Kurtz examined its \\ninfluence and impact in ‘ All the Mothers Are One’ ( published by Columbia university \\npress in 1992 ) .  \\n \\nThe New Cinema and Parallel Movement – Mrinal Sen , a talented movie maker from \\nWest Bengal is considered a pioneer in the new genre called ‘ New wave’ inema . In the  39 early 1970s, he was its main proponent and he had to do a lot of explaining soon after \\nthe release of his BHUVAN SHOME (1969). Without imitating the techniques of \\ncommercially successful movies which are usually mixtures of rapid action , maudlin \\ndrama , violence , erotic dancing and singing , Mrinal Sen could produce a film that was \\nnot only a financial success at the box – office but cut a new path in filmography . \\n    Some critics are of the view that Shyam Benegal’s ANKUR (1974) was the real \\npath – breaker and that Benegal was the pioneer of the New Wave genre. His cinematic \\nlanguage shook the audience with its bluntless and originality.  \\n    Both Mrinal Sen and Shyam Benegal inspired many young film makers of the \\n1970s and 1980s, particularly graduates of the FTII, Pune . There were admirers and \\ndetractors for the new cinema. Some of the film makers created movies that could not \\neasily be followed by ordinary spectators. Only intellectuals of a certain kind could \\nappreciate them. \\n    There is no doubt that these movies opened a new chapter in the history of \\nmovies in India. A totally new generation of film makers emerged. They used new \\ntechniques and evolved a new cinematic language, which was sometimes called \\nidiosyncratic. They are all known for their originality, subversion of conventions and firm \\nbelief in the ‘auteur’ theory of the film. \\nCinema, according to these directors, was the art of the director rather than of \\nthe artistes or the script writers . Each film is the personal expression of a view point , a \\npersonal filmic expression of the director . Many of these movies were not ‘ hits’ at the \\nbox office but they earned the respect and admiration of National and International film \\n– makers and critics . Big names include Govind Nihalani , Ketan Mehta , Mani Kaul , \\nKumar Shahni , Sayeed Mirza , Adoor Gopalkrishnan , G. Aravindan , John Abraham , \\nNirad Mahapatra and Girish Kasaravalli . All of them pioneered a new path in film \\nmaking. All their films differed from the ones generally ‘manufactured’ in the ‘masala’ or ‘ \\nfixed formula’ mould . \\n    Since these movies were not produced for any particular segment of the \\naudience, distributors and theatre owners were not keenly interested in them; they \\nfound the conventional movies were drawing large audiences. Even the great director, \\nSatyajit Ray’s SHATRANG KE KHILAADI (1977) was not a financial success. \\n     The New wave directors were more devoted to the artistic side of their creation. \\nThe distinction between ‘art movies’ and ‘commercial’ movies became a popular way of \\nlabeling movies ever since the new movies came on the scene. But sometimes this \\ndistincton becomes artificial or even meaningless because some ‘ art’ movies have \\nbeen commercial successes and some ‘ commercial’ ones have shown great merit and \\ndistinction on the artistic side and been acclaimed as aesthetic productions . \\n    Some of new movies in the early 1980s dealt with sensitive socio- economic \\nissues. They were also commercial successes. For example, AAKROSH ( 1981 ) which \\nwon the Golden Peacock Award ; ARDHA SATYA, CHAKRA, PATINAARU  \\nVAYATINILE ( Tamil ), SAMSKAARA, MARO CHARITA, ELIPPATTAYAM and \\nCHIDAMBARAM .These won National and International honours .  \\n   In the 1970s, there was also the parallel cinema, with directors like Hrishikesh \\nMukherjee and Basu Chatterjee and Guljar and later, Sai Paranjpye. Their films had \\nsongs and dances and sentiment and appealed to the middle class. By the 1980s, all  40 the art cinema directors were making serials for television. The middle classes wouldn’t \\nstep out of the house. The cities had become so over crowded and lawless that the \\nmiddle classes, even if they had a car and driver, would prefer to see something on \\ntelevision rather than go out. The art cinema was finished by the 1980s because there \\nwas no audience. \\n     The justification given for such films is that the average Indian cinegoer wants \\nrelaxation. Why should he go after realism on the screen after all the hardship he \\nencounters daily in real life. The Indian cinema is different from other types of cinema \\nbecause the Indian spectator is different. He wants relaxation, entertainment, fun, frolic, \\nsinging, dancing, maudlin and sentimental stories, crying and miraculous escape from \\nthe hard realities of life – so goes the argument.  \\n \\nSome New Trends : The early years of the 21st century witnessed several dramatic \\ndevelopments in Indian cinema . Cinema was at last declared an ‘ industry’ in 2001 by \\nthe Indian Government and no sooner did this happen than the gradual ‘ \\ncorporatisation’ of the entertainment and media industry took off . Banks, insurance \\ncompanies and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) \\nwere persuaded to support the industry. The decline of the active dependence on \\nfunding from the ‘underworld’ of Bombay also had its beginnings around this time. \\n   But perhaps the greatest impetus to the shake up of the industry was the rapid \\nproliferation of ‘ multiplexes’ ( multt-screen theatres ) and digital cinema theatres , first in \\nthe metros and later in the big cities such as Bangalore , Hyderabad , Ahmedabad and \\nPune . Multiplexes offer a different experience to cinema goers, for in most cases they \\nare part of a shopping malls and comprise theatres of different sizes. Thus small budget \\nfilms could be released in multipleses and digital cinema theatres. Ticket rates are much \\nhigher in such multiplexes than in single screen theatres and therefore attract upper \\nmiddle class families. \\n   This has given rise to what has to be known as ‘multiplex’ films that is small \\nbudget experimental films on subjects which are rarely touched on in mainstream \\ncinema. Young directors like Nagesh Kukunoor (Hyderabad Blues, Bollywood Calling \\nand Iqbal), Sudhir Mishra ( Hzaron Khawaishen Aisi ) and Anurag Kashyap (Black \\nFriday) have been able to make a mark thanks to the multiplex phenomenon . Small low \\nbudget films like Being Cyrus, Mixed Doubles, Joggers Park and other feature films \\nwere released in such theatres. At the end of 2005, there were at least 300 screens in \\naround a hundred multiplexes across urban India.  \\n  The potential of low budget films at the box office has led to the introduction of \\nnew and bold themes by young directors both in the mainstream and parallel traditions. \\nHomosexuality, old age (Being Cyrus), HIV-Aids (My Brother Nikhil), live-in-relationships \\n(Salaam-Namaste), communication with the physically and mentally challenged (Black, \\nIqbal ) , religious fundamentalism (Bombay , Roja) , nationalist history (Mangal Pandey : \\nThe Rising) , patriotism (Lagaan) , and rural development (Swadesh ) have been some \\nof the  issues taken up for analysis in feature films and documentaries over the last \\ndecade . \\n \\n  41 Regional Cinema : \\n Maharashtra : Indian cinema had its beginning in Maharashtra , but right from the \\nstart, films in Marathi stood no chance against those in Hindi which could draw larger \\ncrowds. Yet, Marathi films have continued to be made. Sant Tukaram, for instance, was \\nperhaps the first Indian film to win high praise at home and abroad. This and other films \\nproduced by Prabhat Talkies have inspired Marathi cinema over the years .The first \\nstudios, however, were set up in Kolhapur – the Maharashtra Film Co. - by Baburao \\nPainter who together with Anandrao , pioneered the silent film era in Western India . \\n    The films of Master Vinayak who worked in collaboration with P.K.Atre, were \\nbrilliant social satires of the forties. During the fifties the foremost director was Raja \\nParanjpe, who collaborated with the poet and screenplay writer, G.D.Madgulkar. The \\nrole of literary figures in the making of Marathi films climaxed in the work of \\nP.L.Deshpandey. In these hands cinema lost much of its visual character and was \\nturned into a literary and wordy product. Perhaps the most significant film of the fifties \\nwas Anant Mane’s Sangtye Aika , based on the life of a popular contemporary actress . \\n   Few films were produced during the 60’s and early 70’s and these were formula \\nfilms – either of the tamasha genre or the family drama. The last few years, however, \\nduring which over a hundred films have been released, have seen some healthy trends \\nin the form and substance of Marathi cinema. The renaissance has come about mainly \\nbecause of the ‘tax refund scheme’ introduced by the State Government. Under this \\nscheme, a film maker has only to make a second film to get a refund of upto 80 percent \\nof the entertainment tax collected by the State Government from his first film. \\n   While in the early Marathi cinema, men of letters were only collaborators, they \\nhave now taken to film making as though it was second nature to them. Jabbar Patel, a \\npaediatrician by profession, is easily the most eminent among them. Scripted by Vijay \\nTendulkar, his first venture Saamna (Confrontation) is about the changing scene of rural \\nMaharashtra, dominated as it has been all these years by sugar barons and power \\npolitics. The second, which is little known, was Jait Re Jait , dealing with tribal life , and \\nthe third Simhasan (Throne) , a political satire on the goings – on in Maharashtra \\npolitics. His Umbartha (Subah in Hindi) based on the novel by Shanta Misal, has a \\nfeminist theme. \\nFilms based on well –known Marathi stage successes have also proved popular. \\nGhasiram Kotwal and Shantata Court Chalu Ahe by Vijay Tendulkar, the latter directed \\nby Satyadev Dube, are cases in point. Other outstanding films of the eighties include \\nSarvasakshi (Omnipresent) directed by Ramdas Phutane, 22nd June 1897 , directed by \\nChinoo and Jayoo Patwardhan , and Devki Nandan Gopala , a biographical film on the \\nlife of Gadge Maharaj , a modern saint , directed by Raj Dutt . \\n   Ramdas Phutane went on to make a film based on a Marathi drama, Down With \\nFestivals, and Shriram Lagoo, a Veteran stage actor and director, made his debut as a \\nfilm director with Zaakol (Omnious shadow) . Vijay Mehta, Arvind Deshpande and Amol \\nPalekar, three big names of the Marathi stage, have also entered the world of cinema: \\nMehta as a director, Deshpande as an actor, and Palekar as both an actor and director. \\nMehta’s film ventues include Smriti Chitre and Rao Sahib while Palekar has directed \\nBangarwadi, Daayra , Dhyasparva and Paheli (Hindi). Other directors who made a mark  42 in recent decades have been Sumitra Bhave, Jabbar Patel, Sai Paranjpye and Arun \\nKhopkar. \\n \\nGujarati : The first Gujarati film was a two-reeler entitled Mumbaini Sethani , released \\non April 9, 1932 . The first feature was Narsinh Mehto .  \\n   In the early seventies Kantilal Rathod’s masterpiece Kanku could be released \\nonly in one theatre for a week at regular shown in Gujarat. Today, even the top-notch \\ntheatres show Gujarati films, and Hindi films have to struggle hard to find a theatre to \\npatronize them. \\n  What was brought about this dramatic turn in Gujarati cinema is the State \\nGovernments move to exempt all films in the state language from any entertainment \\ntax. However, the kind of films made remains unchanged. In the late Rathod’s words : \\nThe mental age of Gujarati cinema has remained five years though it is celebrating its \\ngolden jubilee in 1982. There is no difference between the present films and the ones \\nproduced in 1932. Earlier films such as Narsinh Mehto , Sati Savitri , Ghar Jamai were \\nno different in treatment and content than today’s films . \\n   Until 1972, only 130 films in Gujarati had been made. Then came the film ‘boom’ \\nconsequent upon the State governments generosity in exempting films produced in \\nstudios within the State, on eight prints for a period of six months. Further, a grant of Rs. \\n50,000 per film was given to the studios where the films were shot, though the \\nproducers too were shelling out hire charges to the owners. Despite all this, no film \\nprocessing laboratory, recording studios or editing rooms worth the name exists in the \\nState. All the same, around 40 films are churned out year after year at immense public \\ncost. \\n   In the Gujarat Government’s new General Resolution for Gujarati films , all films \\nwill be charged 10 percent entertainment tax in the first year ( 1981 ) , 20 percent in the \\nfollowing two years ( 1982 and 1983 ) , 30 percent in 1984-85 , and 40 percent in the \\nyear ending April 1986 . Further the General Resolution stipulates that only three (big ) \\nprints would be tax-free for exhibition in areas with a population of over 50,000 , as \\nagainst five big prints in the past , but for smaller areas , nine tax-free prints would be \\nallowed . The resolution has come as a severe blow to Gujarati film producers who \\nclaim that not even 75 percent of their numbers recover their investments, thanks to the \\nprohibitive theatre rentals they are required to pay. \\n  Films critics, however, believe that the ‘golden’ period of popular Gujarati \\ncinema based on folk tales and cheap novels is at an end. Meanwhile, with the setting \\nup of a film co-operative called Sanchar whose members are graduates of the Film \\nInstitutes of Pune, there is hope that a new cinema is in the offing, Sanchar first \\nventure, BHAVNI BHAVAI, made in 16mm and shot on location and directed by Ketan \\nMehta, has already won a national film award and the acclaim of critics. So has MIRCH \\nMASALA. The spirit of KANKU AND KASHI NO DIKRO returned to Gujarati cinema in \\nthe early eighties though in recent years mythologicals and folk dramas have continued \\nto dominate. \\n  43 West Bengal Cinema : The Bengali cinema has been dominated for over three \\ndecades now by Satyajit Ray , Mrinal Sen , Tapan Sinha and Ritwik Ghatak . Ghatak \\ndied in 1976, and Satyajit Ray in 1992. Talented young film makers who have joined the \\nranks of the ‘parallel’ cinema in recent years include Purnendu Pattrea , Buddhadeb \\nDasgupta , Nitish Mukherjee , Gautam Chakraborty , Aparna Sen , Sandip Ray and \\nRituparno Ghosh . But since all of them work at their art like lone wolves there no \\n‘movement’ worth the name to provide them the support that comes from a cooperative \\neffort. The result is that their films win laurels abroad, but can find few exhibitors at \\nhome. The Nandan Film Centre in Calcutta has now come to their rescue. The Centre \\nhas exhibition and documentation facilities, conducts seminars and workshops which \\ndraw film makers from all over the country. \\n              The cinema of West Bengal refers to the Tollygunge – based Bengali film \\nindustry in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. The origins of the nickname Tollywood, a \\nPortmanteau of the words Tollygunge and Hollywood, dates back to 1932. The industry \\nis known for producing many of Indian cinema’s most critically acclaimed Parallel \\ncinema art films, with several of its filmmakers gaining international acclaim, most \\nnotably Satyajit Ray. \\n \\nEtymology :  The film industry based in Kolkata, West Bengal, is sometimes referred \\nas ‘ Tollywood,’ a Portmanteau of the words Tollygunge, a neighbourhood of Calcutta \\nwhere most of the Bengali film studios are located , and Hollywood . Tollywood was the \\nvery first Hollywood – inspired name, dating back to a 1932 article in the American \\ncinematographer by Wilford E. Deming, an American engineer who was involved in the \\nproduction of the first Indian Sound film. He gave the industry the name Tollywood \\nbecause the Tollygunge district in which it was based rhymed with ‘Hollywood’, and \\nbecause Tollygunge was the center of the cinema of India as a whole at the time much \\nlike Hollywood was in the cinema of the United States. Tollywood went on to inspire the \\nname ‘Bollywood’ (as the Bombay – based industry overtook the one in Tollygunge), \\nwhich in turn inspired many others similar names. \\n \\nHistory:  The history of cinema in Bengal dates back to the 1890’s, when the first \\n‘bioscope’ was shown in theatres in Calcutta. Within a decade, the first seed of the \\nindustry was sown by Hiralal Sen, considered a stalwart of Victorian era cinema. When \\nhe set up the Royal Bioscope Company, producing scenes from the stage productions \\nof a number of popular shows at the Star Theatre, Minerva Theatre, Classic Theatre. \\nFollowing a long gap after Sen’s works, Dhirendra Nath Ganguly (known as D.G.) \\nestablished Indo British Film Co, the first Bengali owned production company, in 1918. \\nHowever, the first Bengali Feature Film, Billwamangal, was produced in 1919, under the \\nbanner of Madan Theatre. Bilat Ferat was the IBFC’s first production in 1921 . The \\nMadan Theatre Production of Jamai Shasthi was the first Bengali talkie . A long history \\nhas been traversed since then, with stalwarts such as Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen and \\nRitwik Ghatak and others having earned international acclaim and securing their place \\nin the movie history. \\n \\n  44 Early Development :   \\nSilent Era ( 1919- 1930) :  Hiralal Sen is credited as one of Bengal’s , and India’s first \\ndirectors . However, these were all silent films. Hiralal Sen is also credited as one of the \\npioneers of advertisements films in India. The first Bengali language movie was the \\nsilent feature Billwamangal, produced by the Madan Theatre Company of Calcutta and \\nreleased on 8 November 1919, only six years after the first full- length Indian feature \\nfilm , Raja Harishchandra , was released .  \\n                  The early beginnings of the ‘Talkie Film’ industry go back to the early 1930’s, \\nwhen it came to British India, and to Calcutta. The movies were originally made in Urdu \\nor Parsian as to accommodate a specific elite market. One of the earliest known studios \\nwas the East India Company. The first Bengali film to be made as a talkie was Jamai \\nShasthi, released in 1931. It was at this time that the early heroes of the Bengali film \\nindustry like Pramathesh Barua and Debaki Bose were at the peak of their popularity. \\nBarua also directed a number of movies, exploring new dimension in Indian cinema. \\nDebaki Bose directed Chandidas in 1932; this film is noted for its break through in \\nrecording sound. Sound recordist Mukul Bose found out solution to the problem of \\nspacing out dialogue and frequency modulation. \\n \\nRise of the Talkie ( 1931-1947) : The contribution of Bengali Film industry to Indian film \\nis quite significant . First Bengali talkies Jamai Shasthi (as short film) was released 11 \\nApril 1931 at Crown Cinema Hall in Calcutta and first Bengali talkies as full length \\nfeature film ‘Dena Paona’ was released 30 December 1931 at Chitra Cinema Hall in \\nCalcutta based in Tollygunge, an area of South Kolkata, West Bengal and is more elite \\nand artistically inclined than the usual musical cinema fare in India. \\n \\nGolden Era ( 1952- 1975 ) : During this period , Bengali cinema enjoyed a large, even \\ndisproportionate , representation in Indian cinema, and produced film directors like \\nSatyajit Ray, who was an Academy Honorary Award winner , and the recipient of India’s \\nand France’s greatest civilian honours, the Bharat Ratna and Legion of Honor \\nrespectively, and Mrinal Sen, who is the recipient of the French distinction of \\ncommander of the order of Arts and Letters and the Russian orders of friendship .  \\n        Other Prominent film makers in the Bengali film industry at the time included Bimal \\nRoy and Ritwik Ghatak. The Bengali film industry has produced classics such as \\nNagarik (1952), The Apu Trilogy (1955 – 1959) , Jalsagar (1958), Ajantrik (1958) , Neel \\nAkasher Neechey (1959) , Devdas , Devi (1960) , Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960), etc., in \\nparticular . The Apu Trilogy is now frequently listed among the greatest films of all time. \\n       The most well known Bengali actor to date has been Uttam Kumar, he and co- star \\nSuchitra Sen were known as The Eternal Pair in the early 1050s. Soumitra Chatterjee is \\na notable actor, having acted in several Satyajit Ray films, and considered as a rival to \\nUttam Kumar in the 1960s. He is famous for the characterization of Feluda in ‘Sonar \\nKella’ (1974) and ‘Joy Baba Felunath’ (1978), written and directed by Ray. He also \\nplayed the adult version of Apu in ‘The World of Apu’ (1959), also directed by Ray. One \\nof the most well known Bengali actresses was Sharmila Tagore, who debuted in Ray’s \\n‘The World of Apu’, and became a major actress in Bengali cinema as well as \\nBollywood.  45       The pioneers in Bengali film  music include Raichand Boral, Pankaj Mullick and K.C. \\nDey, all associated with New Theatres Calcutta. Other famous playback singers in \\nBengali Film music were Hemanta Mukherjee, Shyamal Mitra, Manna Dey, Sandhya \\nMukhopadhya and Kishore Kumar. \\n \\n1980s : In the 1980s, however, the Bengali film industry went through a period of \\nturmoil, with a shift from its traditional artistic and emotional inclinations to an approach \\nmore imitating the increasingly more popular Hindi Films , along with a decline in the \\naudience and critical appreciation , with notable exceptions of the works of directors like \\nNripen Saha , Gautam Ghosh. However , even at this time, a number of actors and \\nactresses enjoyed popularity, including Tapas Pal, Prosenjit, Chiranjit, Rituparna \\nSengupta, Gautam Ghosh, Aparana Sen, Sandip Ray among others a number of \\npopular and critically acclaimed movies have come out of the Bengali Film industry in \\nrecent years . These include Unishe April, Titli, Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, Patatghar, Bombaiyer \\nBombeti, Shatru Pakakkha, and Jeeban Jodha and Signal a resurgence of the Bengali \\nfilm industry. \\nBuddhadeb Dasgupta’s NEEM ANNAPURNA , DOOWATWA , and TAHADER \\nKATHA Pattrea’s STREER PATRA , CHENTRA TAMSUKHA , and MALANCHA , Nitish \\nMukherjee’s EKDIN SURYA , NAYAN SHYAMA and RABIDAR didn’t do well at the box \\n–office . \\nUtpalendu Chakraborty made his debut with a documentary MUKTI CHAI and a \\nfeature MOYNA TADANTA, both of which have won national film awards. He went on to \\nmake PHANSI (1989), the tragic tale of a professional hangman, and KANNA (1989), a \\ndocumentary on a Bharat Natyam dancer. Both were NFDC – funded. So were films by \\nGautam Ghose (PAAR , ANTARJALI , YATRA) , Aparna Sen (36 CHOWRINGHEE \\nLANE , SATI , PARAMA , PICNIC) , Raja Mitra (EKIT JIBON) and Sandip Ray \\n(HIMGHAR ) , though some of them were in Hindi and English rather than in Bengali . \\n \\nAndhra : In the South , Andhra produces the largest number of films every year but the \\nleast number in the genre of ‘ parallel cinema’ . The films are pot-boilers in the Hindi \\ncinema style, loaded with song and dance sequences. Mythologicals, folk love \\nfantasies, socials and crime thrillers dominate. Nowhere in sight are films to match the \\nclassics of old –G . Ramabrahman’s Mala Pillai Raita , K.V. Reddi’s BHAKTA POTANA, \\nYogi VEMANA , Chittor V. NAGAIAH’S THAIAGAIAH and B.N. Reddi’s MALLESWARI . \\nShyam Benegal with ANURAGHAM, and Mrinal Sen with OKA CORI KATHA \\ndid try to break into Telegu films but without much success. B.S. Narayan has won \\nnational and international acclaim with his two features, OORUMMADI BRATUKULU, a \\nnaturalistic film about the struggle of the poor, and NAMMAJJANAM which deals with \\nthe suicide of a young bride who is the victim of rape. Two other outstanding films are \\nRavindran’s HARIJAN and Gautam Ghose’s MAA BHOOMI, which focus on the plight of \\nthe have-nots in an exploitative situation. \\n  Telegu cinema shot into the limelight in 1981 with K.Viswanath’s \\nSANKARABARANAM which bagged the Golden Lotus for Mass Entertainer with \\nAesthetic Values. In 1989, his SEVARNA KAMALAM was the only Telegu film selected \\nfor the Indian Panorama.  46   What accounts for the big crop of film each year in Andhra is the State \\nGovernment’s support . It is perhaps the only State Government that ploughs back \\nabout 70 percent of the receipts from entertainment tax into the film industry. The \\nEenadu Group, which is the largest media company in the State, has established a \\nstate-of-the-art studio for film and television production in Hyderabad. \\n \\nTamilnadu : Madras has been a centre for film production in Hindi and the South Indian \\nlanguages , from the early years of Indian cinema . The new wave cinema took over the \\nTamil cinema scene in the late seventies. The pioneers were K. Balachander, Bharati \\nRaja, Mahendran, Balu Mahendra, Dorai, Jayabharati, Bhagyaraj, Rudraiya and H.A. \\nKaja. Mahendran’s UTHARIPOOKAL and Dorai’s PASI continued the realistic genre \\nstarted by the late Bhim Singh’s SILA NARANGALIL SILA MANITHANGAL which \\nchallenged the myth of the ideal heroine. Bharaathi Raja set the trend of locating films \\nin villages, and Mahendra gave the villagers ‘solidity depth and relevance’ in his 16 \\nVAYADINILE. There was a radical move away from the dialogue-oriented film, as in  \\nJ. Mahendran’s MULLUM MALARUM and the cooperative venture of some young \\npeople under the leadership of Robert and Rajasekaran ( ORU THALAI RAGAM ) . At \\nthe close of the century, Mani Ratnam, Illayarajah and A.R. Rehman had succeeded in \\nputting Tamil cinema on the all-India map. \\n \\nKerala : The seventies was the ‘golden’ period of Malayalam cinema . The pioneer of \\nthe new cinema in Kerala was Adoor Gopalakrishnan , who made SWAYAMVARAM in \\nthe early seventies , and since then has been turning out films at regular intervals . His \\noeuvre includes : KODIYETTAM (The Ascent) (1977), ELIPATHAYAM (Mousetrap) \\n(1981), MUKHAMUKHAM (Face to Face) (1984 ) , ANANTARAM  (Monologue ) (1987), \\nMATHILUKAI (The Walls) (1991), VIDHEYAN (Servile Man) (1993), and \\nKATHAPURUSHAM ( Man of History ) (1995 ) . \\nThe late G. Aravindan’s films UTHARAYANAM, KANCHANA SITA, THAMP, KUMMATI, \\nESTHAPPAN, SAHAJA, ORIDATH, MARATTAM and VASTUHARA have won \\ninternational acclaim for their aesthetic and poetic qualities. Malayalam films have had \\nthe largest representation at the Indian Panorama since the 1970s. Film co-operatives \\nhave been one reason for its steady growth. Chitralekha , the film cooperative started by \\nAdoor Gopalakrishnan , has provided the impetus to the growth of Malayalam cinema . \\nThe State Government has set up a film complex in Trivandrum and provides a subsidy \\nto film-makers. \\nSome of the other film makers who have tried to break new ground are : \\nVasudevan Nair (NIRMALAYAM BANDHANAM ), P.A. Backer ( KABANI NADI \\nCHUVANNAPPOL), Padmarajan (PEUYAZHIAMBALAM and KALLAN PAVITHRAN), \\nV.R. Gopinath (GREESHAM), John Abraham (AMMA ARIYAN; CHERIYACHANTE \\nKROGRA KRITHYANGAL (The Wicked Deeds of Chediyachan), Sivan (YAGAM), and \\nK.R. Mohanam ( ASHWA THAMA ) and Shaji N. Kuran ( PIRAVI , VANAPRASTHAM ) . \\nK.G. George (JOURNEY’S END), Lenin Rajendran (A TALE OF THE PAST), \\nK.Ravindran’s (ORE TAHVOOL PAKSHIGAL and VARIKUZHA), are other distinguished \\ndirectors. Those who have made a mark in recent years are : T.Rajeevnath , (THANAL , \\nTHEERANGAL, SURYANTE MARANAM, PURAPPAD , KAVERI KADAL THEERATHU,  47 AHAM AND JANANI), Jayaraj (KUDUMASAMETHAN, SOPANAM, DESADANAM, \\nKALIYATTAM AND KARUNAM) and M .P.Sukumaran Nair (APRAHANAM AND \\nKAZHAKAM ) . \\n \\nKarnataka: The State Government of Karnataka was the first to encourage the regional \\ncinema by offering generous subsidies, and granting tax exemptions to films made in \\nKannada cinema began to wrest national awards. SAMSKARA (1970), and VAMSHA \\nVRIKSHA (1971) , KAADU (1973), CHOMANA DUDI (1975) and HAMSE GEETHE won \\nnational and international acclaim , and inspired the Kannadiga to pay more attention to \\nthe films of his own language rather than to those in Hindi and Tamil . Even the \\ncommercial ventures of Puttanna Siddhalingayya and Raaj Kumar which attempted to \\nblend art with popular entertainment, met with success. \\n   M.S.Sathyu of GARAM HAWA and BARA (Femine) fame, made two big budget \\nKannada films – KANNESHWARA RAMA and CHITEGU CHINTE – and Girish Karnad \\nONDANONDU KALADALLI and TABALIYU NEENADE MAGANE (jointly with karanth). \\nGirish Kasaravalli is the foremost director now with four visually arresting films – \\nGHATTASHRADHA, AAKRAMANA, MOORU DARIGALLU, and MAANE – to his credit. \\nP. Lankesh’s PALLAVI too is a cut above the rest. Girish Karnad’s KONOORU \\nHEGGADITHI (The Mistress of the house of konooru) (1999) retells the classic \\nKannada story of the near destruction of the Chandrayya Gowda family. It is based on a \\nnovel 650 pages long, and ‘was part of one’s growing up’. ‘Directing it’, says Karnad, \\n‘was a way of confronting a seminal influence from a later perspective’. \\n \\nAssam :  Cinema in Assam and the North-East has received much attention at national \\nfilm festivals in recent years . Active support from the State – run Assam Film Finance \\nand Development Corporation has plans of establishing a chain of ‘Janata halls’ for \\nregular exhibition of films. Mobile Cinemas are also being encouraged by exemption of \\nentertainment taxes. The first Assamese film was Jyotiprasad Agarwala’s JOYMATI, \\nreleased in 1935. Agarwala later made INDRA MALATI, but received little recognition. \\nHe is believed to have been the first director to introduce playback singing in Indian \\nCinema. \\n             Assamese cinema is cinema in the Assamese language, watched primarily in \\nAssam, India. The industry was born in 1935 when Jyoti Prasad Agarwala released his \\nmovie ‘Joymoti’. Since then Assamese cinema has developed a slow – paced, sensitive \\nstyle, especially with the movies of Bhabendra Nath Saikia and Jhanu Barua . \\n             However, despite its long history, and its artistic successes, for a state that has \\nalways taken its cinema seriously, Assamese cinema has never really managed to \\nmake the breakthrough on the national scene despite its film industry making a mark in \\nthe National Awards over the years. Although the beginning of the 21st century has \\nbeen Bollywood – style Assamese movies hitting the screen, the industry has not been \\nable to compete in the market, significantly overshadowed by the larger industries such \\nas Bollywood . \\n  48 1930s:  The origins of Assamese cinema can be traced back to the dreams and \\nimagination of a revolutionary visionary Rup Konwar Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, who was \\nalso a distinguished poet, playwriter, composer and freedom fighter. He was \\ninstrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film Joymati in 1935, under the \\nbanner of Critakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyoti Prasad, \\nwhile making his maiden film , had to shoulder the added responsibilities as the script \\nwriter , producer , director , choreographer , editor , set and costume designer , lyricist \\nand music director. The film, completed with a budget of 60,000 rupees was released \\non 10 March 1935. The picture failed miserably. Like so many early Indian films, the \\nnegatives and complete prints of ‘Joymati’ are missing. Some effort has been made \\nprivately by Altaf Mazid to restore and subtitle whatever is left of the prints. Despite the \\nsignificant financial loss from ‘Joymati’, the second picture ‘Indramati’ was filmed \\nbetween 1937 and 1938 finally released in 1939. \\n \\n1940s :  Remaining strong in the face of adversity , Agarwala made another film after a \\nlapse of two years titled ‘Indramati’ . It was his second and last film. The eminent \\ncomposer and singer of Assam Bhupen Hazarika , played a stellar role in the play .With \\nthe passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scene witnessed a temporary lull \\nfor about a couple of years . But things changed with the onset of World War II, Taking \\nadvantage of this, Rohini Kumar Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called \\n‘Manomati’ in 1941. It was followed by films like Parvati Prasad Baruah’s ‘ Rupahi’ \\n(1946), Kamal Narayan Choudhury’s ‘ Badan Barphukan’ ( 1947) , Phani Sharma’s \\n‘Siraj’, Asit Sen’s ‘Biin 1961 ,Biplabi’, Prabin Phukan’s ‘ Parghat’ and Suresh Goswami’s \\n‘Runami’ . \\n \\n1950s :  The most remarkable film of the fiftees was Piyali Phukan which went on to win \\na National Award . The movie was produced by eminent film producer Gama Prasad \\nAgarwala under the aegis of Rup Jyoti Prductions. The film was directed by Phani \\nSharma and music was composed by a young Bhupen Hazarika. The film was about \\nthe life of the freedom fighter Piyali Phukon, who stood against the British rule. He was \\nexecuted by the British on charges of Treason. This film technically was very advanced \\nfor that time. In 1955, a new talent Nip Barua made his directional debut with Smrit \\nParas. His subsequent films ‘Mak Aaru Moram’ and ‘ Ranga Police’  bagged many state \\nawards and the silver medal at the national level . Bhupen Hazarika also produced and \\ndirected his first ‘Era Bator Sur’. Prabhat Mukherjee made a film on the University of \\nMother – hood, ‘Puberun’ (1959), which was shown in The Berlin Film Festival. \\n \\n1960s : The next notable film production was Lachit Barphukan by Sarbeswar \\nChakraborty .Bhupen Hazarika made his unforgettable musical ‘Shakuntala’ which \\nproved equally successful with critics and the press, winning the President’s silver \\nmedal . Following this, a chain of films went into regular production and got released, \\nincluding Nip Barua’s Narakasur, Anil Choudhury’s ‘Matri Swarga’, Brogen Barua’s ‘Itu \\nSitu Bahuto’ and Mukta and Anwar Hussain’s ‘Tejimala’. By the middle of the sixties, \\nfilm began to be produced in Assam on a regular basis. However, between 1935 and \\n1970 a total of 62 films were produced. Besides , the film makers already referred to,  49 many others engaged in film making during the period included Pravin Sharma, Saila \\nBarua, Abdul Mazid , Amar Pathak, Indukal Pattazarika, Diben Barua, Debkumar Basu , \\nAmulya Manna, Gauri Burman, Atul Bardoloi, Sujit Singh, Nalin Duara, and Prafulla \\nBarua .  \\n \\n1970s :   During the period of 1970-82 a total of 57 Assamese films were made. New \\ndirectors started emerging on the horizon , Samarendra Narayan Deb’s ‘Aranya’ (1970), \\nKamal Choudhury’s ‘ Bhaity’ (1972 , the first color film of Assam) Deuti Barua’s ‘ Bristi’ \\n(1974), Manoranjan’s Sur’s ‘ Uttaran’ (1973), Prabin Bora’s ‘ Parinam’ (1974) , Pulok \\nGogoi’s ‘ Khoj’ (1974), Padam Barua’s  ‘Gonga Silonir Pakhi’(1976), Bhabendranath \\nSaikia’s ‘Sandhya Raag’ (1977) and Atul Bardoloi’s ‘ Kollol’ (1978) are films worth \\nmentioning . \\n \\n1980s : Notable directors of contemporary Assamese cinema are Jhanu Barua ( who \\ndirected Aparoopa , Papori , Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai , Bonani , Firingoti and \\nSagoroloi Bohu Door ) , Sanjiv Hazarika ( Haladhar, Meemanxa ) and Bhabendra nath \\nSaikia who directed ‘Sandhya Raag’, ‘Anirbaan’, ‘Agnisnaan’, ‘Sarothi’ , ‘Kolahool’, \\n‘Abartan’ , ‘Itihaas’ and ‘Kaal Sandhya’ ) . Other directors include Santwana Bordoloi \\nwho directed ‘Adaiya’ and Bidyut Chakraborty who made ‘Rag Birag’, both of which \\nhave won national and international awards.  \\n   The forties and fifties saw a crop of films by Rohini Kumar Barua, Parvati Barua \\nand Phani Sharma. In 1955 PIYALI PHUKON  won a national award . In the sixties, the \\nbest known film – makers were Bhupen Hazarika, Padma Barua , Abdul Mazid , Attul \\nBaroli and Manoranjan Sur . By the end of eighties, however, film production had \\nslumped as in the rest of the country. The new films that were made won national \\nacclaim. In 1986 only 11 films were made, and only eight in the following year. But this \\ntoo is creditable since the whole state has only one government owned studio and \\nminimal infrastructure. Most post production work has to be completed in laboratories in \\nCalcutta, Bombay or Madrass . Exhibition theatres do not number more than 143 in the \\nentire State. \\n Jahanu Barua and Bhabendranath Saikia have now put Assamese Cinema on \\nthe international festival circuit. Saikia’s major films include SANDHYA RAG, ANIRBAN, \\nAGNISAAN , and KOLAHAL (1988) , and Barua’s are : APAROOPA ( 1979) , PAPORI \\n(1985), HALODHIA CHORAYE BAODHAN KHAYE (1987), BANNAI (1989) \\nHKHAGOROLOI BOHU DOOR, KUHKHAL , and POKHI (1999). CHOAYE BOODHAN \\nKHAYE  won the Golden Lotus in 1988 , and also the Grand Prix for Best Film and Best \\nActor at Locarno, while HKHAGOROLOI BOHU DOOR  bagged ten international \\nawards including Best Director at the Brussels Festival of Independence Film Makers. \\nBarua and Saikia are in the tradition of ‘new wave’ Indian cinema. They strive for \\nauthentic portrayal of the village ethos , of the struggle of men and women against \\noppression and exploitation . Other film makers of note in Assam include Siba Thakur \\n(ASOUTA PRAHOR), Padma Barua , Jones Mohalia , Gautam Bora , Mridul Gupta and \\nHemanta Das . \\n  50 Manipuri  Films – Around ten films have been produced so far in the Manipuri tongue, \\nwith the first film made in 1972 . Perhaps the most acclaimed Manipuri film has been \\n‘Imagi Ningthem (My Son , My Precious) – 1981], directed by Aribam Shyam Sharma . It \\nwon the Grand Prix at Nantes , France , in 1981 . The film weaves a sensitive tale of a \\nboy who , following his unmarried mother’s death in childbirth , is brought up by his \\ngrandfather . The boy’s father is traced by the local school teacher , and is found to be \\nmarried ; but his wife is only too happy to adopt the boy as her own . Among the other \\nManipuri films of note are : ‘ Matangi Manipur (1972), Ngak – ke-ko Ngangse (1974, \\n‘Lamja Parasuram’ (1975), ‘Khuttang Lamjet’ (1979), ‘ Olangthagee Wangmadasoo’ \\n(1980), ‘ Khonjel’ (1981) , and ‘ Wangma Wangma’ (1982). The Manipuri film is basically \\nMeitei in content , theme and behaviour , though not mainly in form and style . The \\nMeitei film is Imphal based and middle class in Outlook and temper . And the middle \\nclass mind is what constitutes the ‘ Manipuri mind’ .  \\n \\nOriya Cinema -    Perhaps the first film to be made in Oriya was ‘ Sitavivah’ in 1934 . As \\nin the cinema of the other Indian languages , the early Oriya films were for the most part \\nmythologicals . Time was when Oriya films matched the popularity of Bengali films. \\nNotable films up to the fifties were: ‘Lalita’, ‘Mahalakshmi puja’, ‘Dasyu Ratnakar’ and \\n‘Parinam’. Mrinal Sen made Matira Manisha in Oriya , a film based upon Kalandi \\nCharan Panigraha’s Oriya novel of the pre- Independence period . One of the most \\npopular films of the 1960’s was Prabhat Mukherjee’s ‘ Nua Bou’ , replet with songs ; the \\nlead role played by the Veteran Dhira Biswal . \\n           Around 16 feature films are made each year in Orissa, which has only one film \\nlaboratory, namely, the Prasad Kalinga Film Laboratories . A clutch of Oriya film makers \\nof the last two decades , most of them alumni of the film and Television Institute of India \\n, have made a valuable contribution to Oriya cinema . One of the most distinguished is \\nA.K.Bir , whose work includes  ‘Aadi Mamansa’ , ‘Lavanya Preeti’ , ‘Aranyaka’ and \\n‘Shasha Drusht’ (The Last Vision) . Nirad Mahapatra, an FTII alumni, has been \\nrelentless in his scrutiny of the Oriya family system in films like ‘ Maya Miriga’ (The \\nIllusion) (1983) . Other film makers like Sagir Ahmed have focused on children who \\ngrow up without love and care in Dhaare Aalua (1983), and Prafulla Mohanty on child \\nmarriage in ‘ Bhanga’ ( Broken Slate ) (1987). \\n \\nPunjabi Cinema -  Prior to partition , Punjabi films were made in Bombay and Lahore \\nwhere modern studios hummed with activity . There were three studios in Lahore \\n(Punjab Film Company , United Players and Kamla Movietone ) established during the \\nsilent era . Himansu Rai’s ‘ Love Of a Mughal Prince’ was made in the Lahore studios, \\nbut the most successful was A.R. Kardar ( who owned united players ) who made \\naround nine silent films, with English titles such as ‘ Golden dagger’, ‘ Brave Heart’, \\n‘Serpent’ , ‘ Shepherd’, ‘Mysterious Eagle’ and ‘ Wanderimg Dancer’. The English titles \\ninvariably had alternative titles in Punjabi . ‘ The Victim’ for example , was called Bhukh \\nun Bhog , ‘ Wooing Nightingale’ bore the Punjabi title ‘ Bol Tu Bulbul’ , ‘ Jewelled Arrow’ \\nwas ‘ Poonam Nu Chand’, in Punjabi , and ‘ The Dancing Girl’ had the creative title \\n‘Gutter  Nu Gulab’ . However, the ‘talkies’ in the early 1930’s and latter the partition \\nbrought an end to the Lahore ventures . The first Punjab film , K.D.Mehta’s ‘ Sheila’  51 (1935), inspired by Tolstoy’s ‘ Resurrection’ , was premiered at the Corinthian Theatre in \\nCalcutta ; Mehta’s ‘ Heer Sayal’ , base don Warris Shah’s ‘ Heer Ranjha’ , the inmortal \\ntale of Young love , revived the studios of Lahore , though only unil the partition .  \\n               Dalsukh Pancholi (Soni Mehiwal , Gul Bakawli and Yamla Jat) , Roshan Lal \\nShorey (Chaman – 1948) and Roop Shorey ( Mangti , Dulla Bhatti , Koel and Tarzan Ki \\nBeti ) contributed much to Punjabi cinema during the post- partition years . Bombay \\nbécame the hub of Punjabi cinema after the partition , but Pakistan’s ban on Indian \\nfilms, the further división of the state of Punjab , and above all the competition from \\nHindi films dealt a deathly blow to Punjabi films . Devotional  films ( Nanak Nam Jahaz \\nHai , Nanak Dhukia Sab Sansar , Dhanna Jat , Dukh Banjan Tera Nam , Man Jeeta Jag \\nJeeta , and Sherni ) proved to be a big draw during the years of fear and terrorism . \\nOther films worthy of note are : Virendra’s ‘Sarpanch and’  ‘Lambardarni’,         \\nDharmakumar’s ‘Daaj’, Peepat’s ‘Chann Pardesi’ (1980) and Vijay Tandon’s ‘Kachehari’ \\n(1993) .   \\n \\nAnimation Films in India:-Today , when U.S. companies are doing wonders with 3D \\nComputer Generated Imagery (3D CGI ) , India still clings to 2D techniques . Musical \\ninstruments are modeled using comercial 3D animation software and then animated via \\nproprietary aigorithmic animation software in the U.S. , while Indian animation \\ncompanies are still struggling with existing 2D software . Arduously , 2D software takes \\nthe frames drawn by an artista and scans them , and for each carácter , the animator \\ncreates a model . \\n             But what is attracting Indian animation firms is the estimated $50- billion market.   \\nTop Indian companies like Pentamedia Graphics Ltd, UTV Toons , Crest \\nCommunications , Unilazer , Toonz Animation India Ltd , Tata Elxsi and Digital Canvas \\nare busy clinching deals with companies in the U.S. These companies nurse smaller \\nanimation companies by sub-contracting a part of their international projects , including \\nthose from Disney and Warner Brothers (WB) . \\n             Indian animation has interested history . In 1912 , Dadasaheb Phalke produced \\nthe first Indian animation movie , which was followed by a hiatus that lasted over 40 \\nyears . In 1956 , the Films Division set up a cartoon film unit , where Clair Weeks , the \\nveteran Disney animator , was invited to train students . And one of his first students , \\nRam Mohan , went on to found UTV Toons . \\n             In 1997 , Mohan , who had already spent two decades at the Films Division , \\nteamed with United Studios , a división of the UTV group , to spin off an animation \\ncompany . The venture , initially called RM-USL Animation , was rechristened UTV \\nToons in 2000 . Today , it is one of the largest 2D animation companies in India , and \\nMohan is considered the ‘ father of Indian animation’ . \\n \\nCost Factor :-  It costs a prohibitive $400,000 to 500,000 to produce one hour of \\nanimation footage in the U.S. Perhaps that explains why studios there are looking to \\noutsource . \\n             According to Nandini Vaidyanathan , COO of UTV Toons , a división of UTV \\nSoftware Communications Ltd, ‘To cut costs , most studios in the West have been  52 contracting work to countries such as Taiwan and Phillippines . India is relatively much \\nmore cost – effective – it could even be as low as $20,000 per episode .’ It is still \\nunclear whether top animation companies like Disney and WB are really looking toward \\nIndia for outsourcing , although many claim to be executing projects for them . \\n           Take the case of Chennai –based Pentamedia Graphics Ltd . The parent \\ncompany Pentafour Software and Exports Ltd, started with selling CD titles and \\ncorporate presentations . A joint Project with Griboullie , France , for Excalibur was a \\nbreakthrough for the company . The company went on to bag other international \\nprojects like The King and I from WB in 1999 . \\n           V. Chandrasekaran of Pentamedis says , ‘ Initially it was difficult to pitch for the \\nforein anmation projects since India figured nowhere compared to the international \\nlevels of sophistication .’ The Warner Project served as a springboard and it son bagged \\nSindbad : Beyond the Veils of Mists from Improvision Corp. \\n         Today , the company’s turnover for the third quarter stands at $2, 123 million . \\n‘The joint venture with 3dMaxMedia Inc, U.S., to create high –end digital entertainment \\ncontent using cutting –edge tolos for Internet , cinema and TV media was really a fillip ,’ \\nsays Chandrasekeran . Last year, major Hollywood and European studios outsourced \\nservices worth $300 million to India because of the obvious cost advantage . ‘ While a \\n20-minute special effects animation sequence costs about $75,000 in India , studios in \\nthe US charge $150,000,’ says K.Chandra Shekar , head , ( Animation Business ) , Tata \\nElxsi (P) Ltd. \\n         Overseas studios , including American and Canadian ones , which normally \\noutsource their back-end animation work from Australia , Philippines , Taiwan and \\nKorea , are now increasingly veering toward India . \\n \\nMaturity :-  Although yet to mature , animation companies are throwing their ring son \\nthe ‘ classic outsourcing model,’ to which goes the credit of building the ‘ Indian software \\nindustry,’ until of course , the slowdown happened . ‘ If a company can keep the quality \\nof its output at a desirable level with low costs , it can expect to produce movies for \\nHollywood ,’ says Chandrasekaran . While most companies were reeling under the \\nslowdown of last year , it turned out to be one of the best for the Indian animation \\nindustry . [ www.siliconindia.com/magazine/ ]  \\n     In India, however, there seems to be a greater divide between city and rural \\naudiences, as the changing values and modern heroes depicted on the screen do not \\nreflect the social reality that exists across the country. Alike director Karan Johar, the \\nother Director’s in India, break up their business into ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ class centres . ‘A’ \\nclass are the cities, ‘B’ are slightly smaller towns and  ‘C’ centres are villages and rural \\nareas . In a village, a woman is a wife, a woman is a mother , a woman is a sister , but a \\nwoman as a friend ? No way. That is their belief, and that’s how they’ve been raised, \\nthey hav’nt been educated, so they don’t understand a concept like that. So the \\nbusiness of the Director Karan Johar’s film KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI , did in ‘C’ class \\ncentres was much less than everywhere else . Karan Johar always say the most difficult \\nthing to do is to make a universally commercial Indian Film. \\n     Any Indian film juggles several genres and themes at the same time. A violent \\naction scene can quite seamlessly be followed by a dialogue in which a mother tells her  53 son never to be dishonest, and this exchange can then be followed by a comic scene \\nled by one of the film’s secondary characters. It is precisely this mix of genres that \\nmakes the Indian film unique. The multi – genre film was known in the 1970s and 1980s \\nas the ‘masala’ film – the term comes from the idea that, like a curry cooked with \\ndifferent spices, or masala , the Indian film offers a variety of flavours . However this \\nmixing and matching hasn’t always been the norm. \\n    National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) – The NFDC was established \\nby government in 1975 with the major purpose of encouraging the production of quality \\nfilms with a social purpose. Its functions also include the import and export of feature \\nfilms , the distribution of raw film stock , cameras and other production equipment \\nimported from abroad , exhibition of films through existing cinema halls and new ones \\nplanned by the NFDC , providing loans and grants for the production of quality films , \\nand encouraging research and development activities for improving film production \\nmaterials .  \\n     Collaboration with film production companies nationally and internationally also \\ncomes within the purview of the NFDC. A case in point is NFDC’s collaboration with \\nIndo British Films in the production of the famous ‘Gandhi’ movie. \\n    Sub – titling movies is another major activity of the NFDC for which it has \\nestablished the necessary facilities in Pune. It has also opened offices in New York, \\nLondon and Hong Kong, for promoting Indian Films in the foreign market. The NFDC \\nalso provides facilities for the videotaping of films. It has regional offices in different \\nstates. \\n   The Film Festival Directorate which is responsible for organizing National and \\nInternational film festivals and for sending Indian films for participation in foreign \\nfestivals was established in 1973 under the Information and Broadcasting Ministry. \\n \\nFilm Awards – National Film Festivals are being organized since 1953 onwards to \\nencourage producers, directors, artistes and technical experts. All essential personnel \\nconnected with films are honoured annually. One prestigious award is Dada Saheb \\nPhalke Award given for outstanding contribution towards the development of Indian \\nCinema. The Award is given on the basis of the judgement made by two national juries \\nwho scrutinize the films submitted for judgement . The biggest National award is the \\nGolden Lotus ( Swarna Kamal ) and the next one is the Silver Lotus ( Rajat Kamal ) . \\nCash awards and certificates are given along with the medals. Besides National \\nawards, there are state level awards also. The Children’s Film Society (CFS) – Almost \\nall children’s films in India are produced by the CFS, an independent institution \\nincorporated in May 1955. During the past 45 years, the society has produced feature \\nfilms , and short films including puppet and cartoon films . Its films are exhibited through \\nschools and social welfare organizations and through rural mobile film units. Other \\nactivities of CFS include organizing children’s film festivals. \\n   The National Film Archives Of India (NFAI) – The NFAI was established in Pune \\nin 1964 for the collection, classification, documentation and preservation of films for \\nspecial viewing and research. It encourages film studios and the spreading of a healthy \\nfilm culture among people.   54     By now, the NFAI has collected almost 10,000 movies, including free deposits of \\noriginals and copies of films. It also has about 15,000 film – related books, 300 \\nperiodicals, 2000 disc records, about 20,000 still photographs, 5000 film posters, 3,000 \\nsong booklets, 15,000 film strips, 5.000 pamphlets and thousands of press clippings in \\nits collection. \\n   From time to time, the NFAI organizes film appreciation courses to spread a \\nproper film evaluation culture among moviegoers. The FTII Pune, and different \\nuniversities  \\nCo-operate with the NFAI in conducting these courses. Cultural societies can \\nborrow films from the 155 Indian and Foreign films in the archives library and exhibit \\nthem free of cost. \\n    To sum up, the Indian cinema has grown quite big during the past century, \\nespecially during the past six decades. This latter period saw the growth of the cinema \\ninto a mass medium. Despite thematic peculiarities and drawbacks, social conditioning \\nand cultural inhibitions, it has proved its merit in technical perfection, artistic evalution \\nand directorial innovations. Indian cinema, by and large, has remained on the path of \\nclean popular entertainment. In the coming decades , it can give more attention to the \\nsocial dimension of the medium , particularly its use in mobilizing the masses through \\neffective messages on serious issues such as social justice , environmental safety and \\na more rational and scientific approach to human problems . \\n    '"

The retelling of stories known through an oral tradition was an \\nimportant element in the success of the mythological film: The Ram Leela (a celebration \\nand re – enactment of the exploits and adventures of Ram) and the Ras Leela \\n(episodes from Krishna’s life) are said to be of particular influence in Indian cinema. \\nSuch reconfirmation has always been an element of Indian culture.
